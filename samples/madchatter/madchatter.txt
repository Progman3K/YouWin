MadChatter

Peer to Peer chat and file-transfer application. Transfer over wifi to/from anything to anything.

Example: You want to copy a document from your PC to your iPhone/Android.

As long as you are both on the same local network, you can exchange files.

How to use:

When the application is started, it will broadcast its presence and listen for other MadChatter peers.

Select a peer from the list to send him a message/file.

When in broadcast-mode, you can offer a file to multiple madchatters simultaneously.
